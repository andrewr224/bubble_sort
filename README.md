# Project Bubble Sort

## The object is to create a bubble sort method, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

## The Tasks:
1. Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

2. Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller" than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. Use this to sort your array.
